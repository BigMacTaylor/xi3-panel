This is a rough guide to versioning. It is unclear how strictly it will be
followed.

LXPanel shall be versioned according to the semantic versioning scheme, version
2.0.0, available at http://semver.org/. A version is a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH tuple.

The exception is that the major number shall remain at 0, although lxpanel is
already more or less mature.

The lxpanel API consists of:

    - The configuration files:
        * ~/.config/lxpanel/<profile>/config (e.g. data/default/config)
        * ~/.config/lxpanel/<profile>/panels/* (e.g. data/default/panels/panel)

    - The ui files:
        * data/ui/panel-pref.ui
        * data/ui/launchbar.ui
        * data/ui/netstatus.ui

    - The plugin API:
        * include/lxpanel/plugin.h (Must be the same as src/plugin.h)

    - The command line arguments to lxpanel and lxpanelctl.

    - The interface used by lxpanelctl.

    - Libraries used.

    - The lxpanel user interface, including:
        * Look (colors, shapes, arrangements)
	* Behavior
